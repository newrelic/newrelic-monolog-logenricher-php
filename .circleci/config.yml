  "php-5.3":
    # This job is a mess, but for good reasons.
    #
    # The big problem we have is that PHP 5.3 is ancient. Docker Hub's
    # "official" PHP 5.3 images don't include the OpenSSL extension, which is
    # required for Composer to be remotely safe to run, and also predate the
    # convenience scripts shipped in more recent versions to build and install
    # extensions at runtime.
    #
    # To sidestep this, we can use CentOS 6, which ships PHP 5.3.3 as its
    # standard PHP version. This means that we have to do additional setup
    # before even checking out the repository, but it means that we have all
    # the extensions we could want a simple yum invocation away.
    #
    # If we really cared about the performance of this job, the right thing to
    # do would be to define a public Docker image that already had Git, the PHP
    # packages, and Composer baked into it. Realistically, however, we probably
    # won't support PHP 5.3 for long enough for that to be worthwhile.

    # Set up the environment so that there's a "git" binary in the $PATH once
    # the Git 2.9 software collection is installed below.

    # the normal environment variables in the centos:6.10 container.

      # Git, as CircleCI expects it to be available within the container.
      # Unfortunately, the Git available by default in CentOS 6's repositories
      # is too old to work with CircleCI's cloud service (it requires "git
      # checkout -B" to be available), so we need to get a newer one.
      #
      # Fortunately, CentOS has a software collection available with Git 2.9.
      # Less fortunately, this doesn't put "git" into the path, so we have the
